Problem:
    - mailgun is not sending emails to real emails in production (for that you have to have your own domain)
FIX: 
    - style account profile image to fixed width and height
        (bcoz while giving the none sq image it takes it own shape)

TODO: 
    - Better error handing in sign-up error
    - Add logo (FE)
    - Build DELETE user
